/** \page libtut Library Tutorial

This tutorial aims at explaining through a series of examples how to use the
different facilities provided by the LatNet Builder application programming
interface.
The complete code of the examples in this tutorial can be found under the \c
examples/tutorial/ directory.

The library is divided in two namespaces: LatBuilder and NetBuilder. The first namespace
corresponds to the construction of lattice rules whereas the latter deals with
the construction of digital nets. The interdepencecy between these two libraries is explained
in this \ref libtut_impl_spaghetti "section" of the implementation notes.

This tutorial is divided in three parts:
- \subpage libtut_lat
- \subpage libtut_net
- \subpage libtut_impl
